# Usage: yank [FILE...]
#
# Copies the contents of the given files (or stdin if no files are given) to
# the terminal that runs this program.  If this program is run inside tmux(1),
# then it also copies the given contents into tmux's current clipboard buffer.
# If this program is run inside X11, then it also copies to the X11 clipboard.
#
# This is achieved by writing an OSC 52 escape sequence to the said terminal.
# The maximum length of an OSC 52 escape sequence is 100_000 bytes, of which
# 7 bytes are occupied by a "\033]52;c;" header, 1 byte by a "\a" footer, and
# 99_992 bytes by the base64-encoded result of 74_994 bytes of copyable text.
#
# In other words, this program can only copy up to 74_994 bytes of its input.
# However, in such cases, this program tries to bypass the input length limit
# by copying directly to the X11 clipboard if a $DISPLAY server is available;
# otherwise, it emits a warning (on stderr) about the number of bytes dropped.
#
# See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64 for the 4*ceil(n/3) length formula.
# See http://sourceforge.net/p/tmux/mailman/message/32221257 for copy limits.
# See http://sourceforge.net/p/tmux/tmux-code/ci/a0295b4c2f6 for DCS in tmux.
